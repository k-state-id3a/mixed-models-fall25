Experiment: Monitoring herbivore abundance in cabbage plots

Header explanation:

Period - Monitoring period, Mid-season (2) or Late-season (3)
Plot - ID number of the plot in the field 
Accession - the white cabbage plants in the plot were either the accession Badger Shipper (BS) or Christmas Drumhead (CD)
Size - Plots were either 9x9 cabbage plants (L) or 3x3 cabbage plants (S)
Border - Plot was either not surrounded by a Brassica nigra border (0) or was surrounded by a Brassica nigra border (1)
Sum of PR BR + BO - total number of Pieris rapae caterpillars counted in this plot on monitored Brassica oleracea and Brassica nigra combined
Plant-no BN + BO - number of plants that were monitored in this plot to obtain the Sum of PR BN + BO (used as offset)
Sum of PR BN - total number of Pieris rapae caterpillars counted in this plot on monitored Brassica nigra plants (only for plants with border)
Plant-no BN - number of plants that were monitored in this plot to obtain the Sum of PR BN + BO (used as offset)
Sum of PR BO - total number of Pieris rapae caterpillars counted in this plot on monitored Brassica oleracea plants 
Plant-no BO - number of plants that were monitored in this plot to obtain the Sum of PR - BO (used as offset)
